If you are getting this below error in Terraform provider block even after giving ClientId ,subscriptionid,tenantid and secret key:

Error: Error running plan: 1 error(s) occurred:
* provider.azurerm: Unable to list provider registration status, 
it is possible that this is due to invalid credentials or the service principal does not have permission to use the Resource Manager API,
Azure error: resources.ProvidersClient#List: Failure responding to request: StatusCode=403 -- Original Error: autorest/azure:
Service returned an error. Status=403 Code="AuthorizationFailed" Message="The client 'xxxxxx' with object id 'zzz' does not have
authorization to perform action 'Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/providers/read' over scope '/subscriptions/xxxxx'."

Then you need to do this activity on Azure Portal:
1. Go to All Services > Subscription 
2. Go to IAM and Selec Add for Role
3. Now you have to select  Role as Contributor
4. Assign Access to Azure AD user,group or App
5. Search your App which you have created in App registration in Active Directory.
6. Thats all you have to do and can check in Terraform again.
7. you must be able to run Terraform plan
